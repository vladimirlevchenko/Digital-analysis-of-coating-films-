# Digital analysis of coating films 
This repository is created to introduce the digital solution to the drawdown analysis in paint industry.

## Introduction

When new paint or formulation is developed, it's properties have to be thoroughly investigated before the product could end up on the shop's shelf or customer's wall. One of the methods to assess the properties of the paint is called drawdown analysis. Now, depending on type of solvent that paint includes, there are two types of paints - solvent-borne and water-borne. 

(Figure of SB and WB) 

The water- and solvent-borne (WB and SB for simplicity) drawdowns are prepared on different substrates - paper charts or glass plates for WB and metallic plates for SB. Such differences also affect the film appearance. For WB drawdowns, it is fairly straighforward to see crators, flow and levelling defects and other surface defects. For the SB drawdowns, one has to carefully analyze the film's surface...

WB - two colored charts
SB - circle the defects using a marker.
